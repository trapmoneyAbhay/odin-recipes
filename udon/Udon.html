       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>All purpose flour</li>
       <li> Kosher salt </li>
        <li>Water </li>
    </ul>

        Directions
    </h3>
    <ol type="1">
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.</li>
<li>Add 1 1/4 cups water</li>
<li>Use hands to mix until dough starts to come together in a few large lumps. </li>
<li>Firmly press and knead the dough, incorporating any loose flour until there is none left.</li>
<li>If necessary, add a little more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you can incorporate all of the flour.</li>
<li>
    Knead the dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover dough with plastic and let it rest for about an hour. This will make the dough relax and easier to roll out. *Jaden’s note – I like resting the dough for over an hour (timing is flexible here…I’ve let my dough rest anywhere between 1-3 hours, just keep it covered in plastic wrap), it just makes it so much easier to roll out!
