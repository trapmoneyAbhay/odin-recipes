       <h2>Description</h2>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Yeast: Instant yeast makes the job quicker. You need 1 standard packet.</li>
       <li> Water: Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is too hot.</li>
        <li>Flour: Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs.</li>
       <li> Oil: Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough. Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.</li>
       <li> Salt: Adds flavor.</li>
       <li> Sugar: A little sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the pizza dough.</li>
       <li> Cornmeal: Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan; it gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions:</h4>
<li>In a glass or plastic bowl, combine yeast, water, and sugar (the water can just be water from the tap, make sure it's below 100°F).
Stir to dissolve the yeast and let the yeast "bloom" for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in 1 cup flour, add salt, and then stir in another cup of flour (the remaining cup of flour will be your "bench" flour and added flour).
Dump mixture onto kneading board and work in last cup of flour, kneading until dough is soft and elastic, but not sticky. Form dough into a ball.
In another bowl, pour in the 1 tbsp olive oil and spread around.</li>
<li>Coat ball of dough with oil and cover bowl with a damp towel and let dough rise for 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Punch down dough and knead on board about 2 minutes. Dough is now ready to spread in the pan.</li>
<li>To avoid sticking of crust, lightly spray pizza pan with olive oil or vegetable oil spray and then work dough to pan (or use free form pan) - this dough is enough for 1 14-in pizza with a thin bottom crust and enough dough around the edge to munch.</li>
